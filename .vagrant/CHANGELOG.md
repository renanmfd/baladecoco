### New/changed variables in default.config.yml

  * `apache_packages_state: latest` added to ensure latest Apache version is installed.
  * `firewall_disable_firewalld: true` and `firewall_disable_ufw: true` to ensure the system default firewalls are disabled on CentOS and Ubuntu, respectively (we set up our own rules, so this prevents weird problems).

### Improvements

### Breaking Changes

  * N/A

### New/changed variables in default.config.yml

  * There's a new `apache_vhost_php_fpm_parameters` variable that defines the PHP-FPM handler Apache uses per-virtualhost. The old `extra_parameters` pre-4.1.0 will continue to work, but the new `SetHandler` technique is better for most scenarios than using `ProxyPassMatch`.
  * The Dashboard entry in `nginx_hosts` now has `is_php: true`.

### Improvements

  * #617: Switch to `SetHandler` instead of `ProxyPassMatch` (fixes #617, #876, #945, #1055).
  * #1090: Update docs to reference `SetHandler`.
  * #1047: Add docs on Drupal Console remote command execution.

  * #1060: Fix bug where dashboard assumes optional vhost docroot is defined.

## 4.0.0 "We've Got Company" (2016-12-10)

### Breaking Changes

  * Drush is now an optional `installed_extra`. **If you use Drush, and it's not installed as part of your own project's dependencies**, make sure you add `drush` as one of the `installed_extras` in your `config.yml`.
  * Vagrant 1.8.6 or later, VirtualBox 5.1.10 or later, and Ansible 2.2.0 or later (if installed on host) are now required.
  * PHP 7.0 is still the default, but **you can install PHP 7.1**, or **switch to PHP 5.6** on-the-fly, thanks to #1043â€”on any supported OS! See the updated docs: [Using other versions of PHP](http://docs.drupalvm.com/en/latest/other/php/)

### New/changed variables in default.config.yml

  * `drush` is now a default item in `installed_extras`.

  * _If you're running PHP 5.6 with the `geerlingguy/ubuntu1404` box_: PHP 5.6 under Ubuntu 14.04 was using a deprecated PPA. Since switching to Ondrej's updated PPA, we had to also update the list of packages/paths in the [documentation for running PHP 5.6 under Drupal VM](http://docs.drupalvm.com/en/latest/other/php-56/). If you are using PHP 5.6, be sure to update your `php_*` variables (see: #921).

## 3.3.1 (2016-10-05)
